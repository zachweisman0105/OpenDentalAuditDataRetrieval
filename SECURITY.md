# Security Policy

## HIPAA Compliance

This CLI tool is designed with HIPAA compliance requirements in mind. Below are the security measures implemented to protect Protected Health Information (PHI).

### PHI Protection

#### 1. Credential Storage
- **Master Password Protection**: ALL credentials protected by bcrypt-hashed master password
  - **Password hashing**: bcrypt with 12 rounds (cost factor)
  - **Salt**: Unique random salt per password (generated by bcrypt)
  - **Verification**: Required before any credential access
  - **Retry limit**: 3 attempts maximum before lockout
- **Primary**: OS-native keyring with AES-256-GCM encryption
  - Windows: Credential Manager (DPAPI encryption)
  - macOS: Keychain (AES-256 encryption)
  - Linux: Secret Service API (encryption varies by backend)
- **Fallback**: Environment variables (with security warning displayed, no password protection)
- **Never**: Plain text files, command history, or logs

**Security Model**: Two-layer protection
1. **Master password** (bcrypt, 12 rounds) - prevents unauthorized access to stored credentials
2. **OS keyring** (AES-256) - encrypts credentials at rest

#### 2. Audit Logging
- **Location**: `audit.log` with restrictive permissions (0o600)
- **Format**: JSON with UTC timestamps
- **Content**: Operation type, endpoint, HTTP status, duration
- **PHI Sanitization**: Automatic filtering of 21 PHI field types:
  - Patient identifiers (PatNum, FName, LName, SSN)
  - Dates (Birthdate, AptDateTime, DateStatement)
  - Contact info (Address, HmPhone, WkPhone, Email)
  - Medical data (ProcDescript, ToothNum, NoteText, Subscriber)

#### 3. PHI Redaction in Output
- `--redact-phi` flag replaces sensitive values with `[REDACTED]`
- Preserves JSON structure for debugging
- Safe for sharing with technical support

#### 4. Output File Permissions
- JSON output files created with 0o600 permissions (owner read/write only)
- Parent directories created with restrictive permissions
- File overwrite confirmation required (unless `--force` flag used)

### Network Security

#### TLS/SSL
- **Minimum TLS version**: 1.2
- **Certificate validation**: Enabled and enforced
- **Certificate pinning**: Not implemented (relies on OS certificate store)

#### API Communication
- **Timeout enforcement**: 45s total, 10s connect, 30s read
- **Retry logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) ± 20% jitter
- **Circuit breaker**: Opens after 5 consecutive failures, 60s cooldown
- **Rate limit handling**: Respects `Retry-After` header (429 responses)

### Authentication

#### Master Password
- **Purpose**: Required to access stored API credentials
- **Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 rounds (slow hashing prevents brute force)
- **Storage**: Hash stored in OS keyring under service `opendental-audit-cli-password`
- **Verification**: Every credential access requires password verification
- **Password Reset**: `opendental-cli config reset-password` (requires credential reconfiguration)
- **Password Change**: `opendental-cli config change-password` (requires current password)

#### API Keys Security (Developer Key & Developer Portal Key)
- **Authentication Format**: ODFHIR (OpenDental FHIR) authentication scheme
  - **Format**: `Authorization: ODFHIR {DeveloperKey}/{DeveloperPortalKey}`
  - **Example**: `Authorization: ODFHIR abc123def456/xyz789portal`
  - **Single Header**: Both keys combined in one Authorization header (not separate custom headers)
- **Storage**: Both keys stored in OS keyring only (never in code, config files, or environment by default)
- **Access Control**: Password verification required before any credential retrieval
- **Transmission**: HTTPS only with TLS 1.2+, combined in single ODFHIR Authorization header
- **SecretStr Protection**: Keys use `SecretStr` type to prevent accidental logging or exposure in error messages
- **Rotation**: Manual via `opendental-cli config set-credentials` (requires password)
- **Revocation**: Immediate effect (credentials fetched per execution)

### Known Limitations

#### 1. Python Memory Security
- **Issue**: Python does not zero memory after variable deletion
- **Impact**: Master password, API keys (Developer and Customer), and PHI may remain in process memory until garbage collection
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Password and credentials retrieved only when needed
  - Short-lived processes (CLI completes and exits)
  - Avoid long-running daemon mode
  - Master password promptly cleared after verification
- **Recommendation**: Do not run on shared multi-user systems

#### 2. Master Password Security
- **Issue**: Password must be entered each time CLI is run
- **Impact**: Password may be visible during entry on insecure terminals
- **Mitigation**:
  - Password input is hidden (not echoed to screen)
  - 3-attempt limit prevents brute force attacks
  - No password caching or session persistence
- **Recommendation**: Use secure terminal, verify no screen recording/monitoring

#### 3. Terminal History
- **Issue**: Command-line arguments visible in shell history
- **Impact**: PatNum and AptNum may be logged to `~/.bash_history` or equivalent
- **Mitigation**: 
  - PatNum/AptNum are identifiers, not direct PHI
  - Use `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` and prefix commands with space
  - Clear history after sensitive operations: `history -c`
  - Master password never appears in history (prompted securely)

#### 4. Process Listing
- **Issue**: Running processes visible via `ps` or Task Manager
- **Impact**: PatNum and AptNum visible to other users on same system
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Run on dedicated workstations
  - Short execution time (<60s typical)
  - Use sudo/admin privileges to restrict process visibility
  - Password not visible in process list (secured via prompt)

#### 5. Log Aggregation
- **Issue**: If `audit.log` is sent to centralized logging system
- **Impact**: PHI sanitization must be verified in downstream systems
- **Mitigation**:
  - Review log aggregation pipeline for additional PHI filtering
  - Do not send raw audit logs to third-party services
  - Verify no PHI in logs before external transmission
  - Password never logged (Article II compliance)

### Security Best Practices

#### For End Users
1. **Create strong master password** - Use a unique, memorable password
2. **Never share master password** - Each user must have their own password
3. **Never share API keys** (Developer or Customer keys) via email, Slack, or unencrypted channels
4. **Use dedicated API keys** for this tool (not production admin keys)
5. **Rotate keys regularly** (every 90 days minimum) - Use `config set-credentials` with password
6. **Change password regularly** (every 90 days) - Use `config change-password`
7. **Audit access logs** in OpenDental API dashboard
8. **Use `--redact-phi` flag** when sharing output for troubleshooting
9. **Secure output files** - Delete after use, never email PHI
10. **Password reset procedure** - If forgotten, use `config reset-password` then reconfigure credentials

#### For Developers
1. **Never log PHI** - Use PHISanitizerProcessor for all logging
2. **Validate input** - PatNum/AptNum must be positive integers
3. **Test offline** - Use respx for HTTP mocking, never live API
4. **Review PRs** for PHI leakage in logs, errors, or output
5. **Update dependencies** regularly for security patches

### Encryption Details

#### Keyring Storage

- **Windows (DPAPI)**:
  - Encryption: AES-256-GCM
  - Key derivation: User login credentials + machine-specific key
  - Storage: Windows Registry (encrypted blobs)

- **macOS (Keychain)**:
  - Encryption: AES-256 (default keychain encryption)
  - Key derivation: User login password
  - Storage: `/Users/<user>/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db`

- **Linux (Secret Service)**:
  - Encryption: AES-128 or AES-256 (depends on backend)
  - GNOME Keyring: Encrypted with user password
  - KWallet: Encrypted with user password or GPG key

#### Transport Layer

- **TLS 1.2+**: Minimum supported version
- **Cipher suites**: Determined by httpx/SSL library defaults
- **Certificate validation**: Enforced via `verify=True` in httpx client
- **Certificate store**: OS-native certificate trust store

### Password Reset Procedure

If master password is forgotten or compromised:

1. **Reset Password**:
   ```bash
   opendental-cli config reset-password
   ```
   - Confirms twice (irreversible action)
   - Deletes master password from keyring
   - Stored credentials become inaccessible

2. **Reconfigure**:
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Create new master password
   opendental-cli config set-password
   
   # Step 2: Re-enter API credentials
   opendental-cli config set-credentials
   ```

3. **Security Notes**:
   - Old credentials remain in keyring but are inaccessible without old password
   - For complete cleanup, manually delete keyring entries or reinstall
   - Change password if compromise suspected (use `config change-password` if known)

### Incident Response

If PHI exposure occurs:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Change master password** if credential compromise suspected
   - Rotate compromised API keys (both Developer and Customer keys)
   - Delete exposed audit.log or output files
   - Document scope of exposure (which records, how many)

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review audit logs to identify when/how exposure occurred
   - Check for unauthorized password reset attempts (3-attempt limits)
   - Determine if additional records were accessed
   - Identify root cause (bug, misconfiguration, credential/password compromise)

3. **Notification** (if required by HIPAA Breach Notification Rule):
   - Notify affected individuals (if ≥500 records)
   - Report to HHS Office for Civil Rights
   - Follow organizational breach response plan

4. **Remediation**:
   - Apply fix to prevent recurrence
   - Update security documentation
   - Conduct security training for users
